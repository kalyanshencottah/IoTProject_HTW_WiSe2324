# IoTProject_HTW_WiSe2324
# Motivation 
This Project is part of deliverable of Winter Semester (WS2324) Coursework Internet of 
Things (IoT) guided by Professor Alexandar Huhn for the Programme, Professional IT 
Business and Digitalization at Hochschule for Technik und Wirtschaft (HTW), Berlin. 
Motivation of this Project is to gain understanding of the IoT concepts as discussed in the 
class. Concepts include Protocols such as MQTT, Eclipse Paho, and COAP, use of softwares 
such as Node-Red to create Flows that gets deployed to Raspberry PI, Use of Thonny to 
deploy code to Microcontroller, Simulation using WokWi and interaction with Telegram Bot. 
This documentation explains the literatures I surveyed to gain Conceptual understanding User 
Interface used, Data Processing aspects, Connectivity and Nodes, and then the execution of 
tasks to gain practical experience. Screenshots are provided to support my understanding and 
experience gained.
# Technologies used: Micro Python, Node RED, JSON, OpenWeatherAPI, Telegram Bot Interface, PostgreSQL DB Interface
